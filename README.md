# Chat-iOS
Simple Chat iOS Application - Proof of concept for use in UBook (future iOS Application)

I am building this before starting "UBook". 
That application will be a used text book marketplace for colleges - Umass Amherst to start.
It will have two main components, a marketplace and a chat (used to facilitate the transaction).
This Chat app is a precursor to UBook, and the User/Chat model will be built off of it.

Its Dependencies are CocoaPods, Firebase, and JSQMessages.
